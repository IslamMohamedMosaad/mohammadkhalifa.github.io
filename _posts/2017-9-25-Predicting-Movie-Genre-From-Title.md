## Predicting movie genre from its title


```python
import numpy, pandas as pd
import sklearn
```


```python
data = pd.read_csv('movies.csv',quotechar='"')
```


```python
data.head()
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>movieId</th>
      <th>title</th>
      <th>genres</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Toy Story (1995)</td>
      <td>Adventure|Animation|Children|Comedy|Fantasy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Jumanji (1995)</td>
      <td>Adventure|Children|Fantasy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Grumpier Old Men (1995)</td>
      <td>Comedy|Romance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>Waiting to Exhale (1995)</td>
      <td>Comedy|Drama|Romance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

### drop non ascii titles


```python
def is_ascii(s):
    return all(ord(c) < 128 for c in s)

data = data.drop(data[data['title'].apply(lambda t: not is_ascii(t))].index)

```

### Processing title 
We strip away numbers, parenthesis... etc


```python
import re
def process_title(title): 
    # strip away numbers and parenthesis
    title = title.replace('(','').replace(')','')
    title = re.sub(r'\d+','',title)
    # strip away "part" word
    title = re.sub(r'[Pp]art','',title)
    #strip II and III and IV
    title = title.replace('II','').replace('III','').replace('IV','')
    return title

data['title'] = data['title'].apply(process_title) 
#drop empty titles
data = data.drop(data[data['title'].str.strip() ==''].index)
```

### Converting to binary classification
This is a multilabel classification problem, we will convert it to set of binary classification problems 


```python
# drop movies with no genres
data['genres'] = data['genres'].apply(lambda gs:gs.lower())

# get all genres
genres = set()
for gs in data['genres'].str.split('|'):
    genres |= set(gs)
genres.remove('(no genres listed)')

for g in genres:
    data[g] = data['genres'].apply(lambda gs: 1 if g in gs.split('|') else 0)
```


```python
data.head()
```

## Treating it as text classification using Naive Bayes


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
train, test = train_test_split(data, train_size = 0.6)
```


```python
from collections import defaultdict
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
genres = train['main_genre'].unique()

# genre probability


p_genres = {}
count_genres ={}
for g in genres:
    count_genres[g] = len(train[train['main_genre'] == g].index)
    p_genres[g] = count_genres[g]*1.0 / len(train.index)

prob_word_given_genre = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda :0))

#compute counts onlu
for i,row in train.iterrows():
    words_in_title = word_tokenize(row['title'])
    for word in words_in_title:
        prob_word_given_genre[word][row['main_genre']]+=1.0


```


```python
import math
K = 0.05 # smoothing factor
V = len(prob_word_given_genre) # vocabulary size

def get_prob_genre_given_word(genre, word):
    return ( (K + prob_word_given_genre[word][genre]) * p_genres[genre]) / (count_genres[g] + K*V)
    

def get_genre_for_title(title):
    title = title.lower()
    probs = defaultdict(lambda :0.0)
    for w in word_tokenize(title):
        for g in genres:

### Testing accuracy
