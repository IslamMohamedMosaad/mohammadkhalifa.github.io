Haven't posted in a while, but I decided to get back and get back strong! In this post, I will discuss the 2016 paper [Language as a Latent Variable: Discrete Generative Models for Sentence Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07317). The reason why I chose this paper is two-fold : First, it combines a lot of important ideas and concepts such as **Variational Auto Encoders**, **Semi-Supervised learning** and **Reinforcement Learning**. Second, it's relevant to my master's thesis and I find that writing about a topic help make it clearer.
