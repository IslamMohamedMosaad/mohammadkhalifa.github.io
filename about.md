I'm a software engineer fascinated by Machine Learning and NLP. I have made this blog to share some insights and ideas I have worked on. Doing some of this work has been a great journey for me and I hope it will be for you too.

## Current projects

* Currently I'm doing research on early rumors detection.
* I'm also working on implementing automatic summarization with deep neural networks.
* I'm also working on a mobile application using Native Script
